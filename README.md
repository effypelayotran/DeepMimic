# mujoco_resources

The form asks you to provide a link to a Github repository that contains your code and a README. The repository should be public*, and the README should include:
Your project group name
The names of all group members
The title of, authors of, and a link to the paper you implemented
At least one representative image or video demonstrating your results
A copy of / link to your presentation slides
If you elect to upload a copy of the slides to your repo, they should be in .pptx format.
If you instead link to a Google Slides presentation, please ensure that the presentation has view permissions enabled for “anyone on the internet,” as do any embedded videos. Every year, there is someone who forgets to do this step; don’t be that person!
